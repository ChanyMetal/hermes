Welcome to Hermes2D
===================

Hermes2D is a C++ library for rapid prototyping of space- and space-time 
adaptive hp-FEM solvers. Novel PDE-independent hp-adaptivity algorithms 
allow the user to solve a large variety of PDE problems ranging from 
stationary linear equations to complex time-dependent nonlinear multiphysics 
PDE systems (see videos). The library is developed in collaboration with 
CSE experts, it follows newest trends in software engineering, and it comes 
with a free interactive online lab powered by UNR computing facilities. 
Detailed tutorial enhanced with many benchmarks  and examples allow the 
user to use Hermes2D without being expert in object-oriented programming, 
finite element methods, or in the theory of partial differential equations. 
There is a very active user community where help can be obtained quickly.
