# This CMake.vars builds a minimal version of hermes (only real, no additional
# modules, examples or tutorials). Then you can only enable things that you
# need. This is useful for developing, so that you don't need to wait couple
# minutes to compile the whole hermes, but just compile the necessary parts.
