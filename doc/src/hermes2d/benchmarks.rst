Benchmarks with Known Exact Solution
====================================

This section contains the description of selected `benchmarks 
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/tree/HEAD:/hermes2d/benchmarks>`_.
Contrary to regular examples, benchmarks typically do not have 
a significant physical or engineering motivation. On the other hand,
they come with a known exact solution and thus they are a great 
resource for comparisons of various methods and adaptivity algorithms.
