NIST Benchmarks
===============

This section contains dozen benchmarks with known exact solutions 
from Bill's Mitchell  
`NIST report 7668 <http://math.nist.gov/~WMitchell/papers/easpaper.pdf>`_.
These benchmarks are all "simple" elliptic equations in simple 
geometries, and they exhibit various difficulties that pose 
problems to adaptivity algorithms.
