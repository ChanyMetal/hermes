Benchmarks with Known Exact Solution
====================================

This section contains the description of selected `benchmarks
<http://git.hpfem.org/hermes.git/tree/HEAD:/hermes3d/benchmarks>`_.
Contrary to regular examples, benchmarks typically do not have 
a significant physical or engineering motivation but they came 
with a known exact solution and thus they are a great resource 
for comparisons of various methods and adaptivity algorithms.
