Interactive Web Accessibility
-----------------------------

* **Interactive web usage**. You can use Hermes (and other major open source FEM codes) remotely via any web browser, using the `FEMhub Online Numerical Methods Laboratory <http://lab.femhub.org/>`_. Your hardware will not be used as the online lab is powered by the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) high-performance computing facility (`Research Grid <http://hpc.unr.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`_). In this way you can compute with Hermes using any platform that supports web browsing, such as an iPhone:

See the `Hermes home page <http://hpfem.org/hermes/>`_ for more information. An overview of books, 
journal articles, conference proceedings papers and talks about Hermes and adaptive *hp*-FEM can be 
found in its `publications section <http://hpfem.org/publications/>`_.
